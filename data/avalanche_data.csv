Events leading up to the accident:
The 2009-10 season overall had lacked much of the snow that the local riders have grown
accustomed to. The powder days up through mid January had been few and far between.
The month of January was very dry and the snow conditions were thin and very worn out.
There was very little enthusiasm for any travel off of the main groomed runs. So when
there was a report of a large storm, anticipation for new snow was definitely high. The
riding conditions improved each day as the snow continued to fall. By the morning of the
24th 36 inches of new snow had made the riding conditions within the resort excellent.
For the backcountry there was an avalanche warning in effect and the danger rating was
extreme.
On the 24th of January, Ben Pett and Todd Bell had been skiing together all morning.
Both of them were familiar with the area as they had been skiing at Snowbasin for some
time. Todd was a former employee of the resort in the mid 90’s and had good knowledge
of the terrain. Todd and Ben decided to head up the John Paul lift and make a run in the No
Name area. No Name is known to be the premier powder terrain at Snowbasin ski resort
with a near continuous vertical drop of close to 3000 feet. Adjacent to No Name is easy
access into uncontrolled backcountry terrain of Hells and Coldwater Canyon.
On the lift ride up John Paul Ben stated that he and Todd had a discussion about how
dangerous the conditions were in the backcountry, and because of these conditions their
plan was to ski adjacent to the boundary in No Name all the way out to the bottom of the
Lower Pyramid. They travelled together to near the top of No Name peak where they
caught their breath and put their skis on. Once more they discussed their plan of skiing
near the boundary and staying in bounds. This was the last place/time Ben would see
Todd (approx. 13:00 to 13:05). Ben pushed off and skied a line next to the Gazex
exploder (No Name drain) and stopped in the trees on the skier’s left to look for Todd
(near the ridgeline and the top of “Lust”). He looked uphill, but didn’t see Todd. He
assumed that they had just gotten separated, so he continued down the run, skiing out the
Lower Pyramid and coming out at the power station. He stated he reached the bottom
around 13:15. Since Todd was planning to make this his last run, Ben wasn’t
immediately alarmed that his friend wasn’t there (or hadn’t waited for him). Ben was
confident that Todd would be OK because he knew the mountain very well and was an
excellent skier. Ben then called a friend, found out what car Todd was driving, and
discovered that his car was still in the parking lot. At this point, he became alarmed and
notified dispatch that Todd was missing. By the time he contacted the Ski Patrol they
were well into the recovery operation.
Ben stated that Todd was not wearing a beacon. Todd did have a pack, but likely was not
carrying a shovel or probe. Ben was wearing a beacon.
Jason Warner a friend of Todd’s also walked into dispatch and stated that Todd was a
good skier. He knew the area well, both inbounds and out of bounds. He was very
experienced in the area. He estimated that Todd had been skiing in Hell’s Canyon
hundreds of times.
Information from group of snowboarders on scene:
On their first “lap through No Name,” a group of 5 snowboarders left the ski area at the
top of No Name, passing the Forest Service brown sign. They noticed 4 or 5 tracks ahead
of them, likely snowboard tracks. None in the group carried beacons, shovels or probes,
although they usually do have all three with them (gear was in the car). Unaware if they
had checked the avalanche advisory that day.
They rode down the traditional “Sloth Ridge” route and likely rode down “Pride” into
“Anger Confluence.” At this point, they noticed fresh debris from an avalanche that had
come down near the run-out of “Lust.” They reported that it appeared to have run with
some speed and force, as it looked to have washed up over the bank on the observer’s left
of the slide path. They observed dirt in the slide path. Then they continued down
drainage, traversing to the skier’s right of the drainage and debris, attempting to make the
traverse back to the ski area They travelled approximately 100 yards past the confluence
with “Lust” when Nick spotted a jacket on the surface of the snow. The victim was on
their left, down in the bottom of the drainage. Nick skied down first and was
immediately joined by the rest of the group. They saw a person (Todd) buried in the
snow. He was sitting upright, leaning uphill, with legs bent, almost in a ball. He had his
feet downhill and head uphill. His head was covered by approx. 6 inches of snow, but
both knees and an arm were sticking out of the snow. He was found at the toe of the
debris. They described it like the snow had pushed him along to the very end of the slide.
Tony seemed to have a basic understanding of CPR and checked for a pulse. The victim
was unresponsive from the start. He did not detect a pulse and the victim was not
breathing. At this point they called 911 and the Weber County dispatcher instructed them
to begin CPR. They estimated reaching him at approx. 13:20 and made the 911 call at
approx. 13:22. They performed CPR for approximately 1 hour. They informed the
Weber County dispatcher that they were still in a slide path and likely in danger, but said
the dispatcher instructed them to continue CPR. The 911 dispatcher “called it” after one
hour and they stopped CPR.
A sixth snowboarder (a friend) was riding solo and joined the group at the scene some
time after they found Todd. This sixth person stated that he followed approximately the
same route as the rest of the group.
The victim was described as a male in his mid-40’s. He was wearing a blue jacket, black
pants and blue alpine ski boots. No skis or poles were found on scene. Nothing was on
his head (no goggles/hat/helmet/etc.). He was not wearing gloves, but they found 2
gloves, approx. 20 feet uphill from the victim. The gloves were black, Reusch “racing”
gloves. He was wearing a pack, but one of the straps had been broken.
The group did not have a beacon to mark the victim (in case of subsequent slides), but
they did make an “X” with branches to the skier’s left of the victim, up on a small ridge,
approx. 25-30 yards away, out of the slide path.
Snowbasin dispatch instructed the group to leave the scene and travel down canyon
where Ski Patroller Doug Wewer would meet them. Doug had left the ski area boundary
near the intersection of Mustache Ridge and the Dead Deer traverse and traversed to
Vanity Face. He skinned up from there and travelled to a small sub-ridge just West of
Vanity Face, where he could see the lower Hell’s Canyon drainage. The group informed
him that they travelled about 80 to 100 yards down canyon and around a bend before they
first made audible/visual contact with each other. Doug dropped into the drainage
bottom, met them, discussed the exit plan and escorted them to the power station. They
all walked together to dispatch and began paperwork.

Snowmobiler caught in avalanche dies
December 31st, 2007 @ 10:01pm

Sarah Dallof reporting
An Altamont man died in an avalanche while snowmobiling with friends and family in Summit County.
""It was a significant slide. It took the snow right down to dirt level,"" authorities said.
Dale Christensen, 40, was flown by helicopter to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, where he was pronounced dead.
 

The avalanche happened near the Co-op Creek area in Summit County, about 10 miles east of Heber City, near Strawberry Reservoir.
Ron Hazard, of the Wasatch County Sheriff's Office, said, ""The slide was about 200 feet wide and 1,000 feet long, and it took the snow down to dirt and rocks.""
The massive slide hit three snowmobilers who were fixing one of the men's machines Monday afternoon. Two swam out; the third was buried for about 45 minutes.
""We started CPR immediately, and LifeFlight came in and transported the victim with CPR in progress,"" Hazard said.
Christensen wasn't wearing an avalanche beacon.
""I don't know what else to say. It's dangerous out there, and the snow needs to be respected,"" Hazard said.
This is the third avalanche to bury people in just over a week. The first, on Dec. 23, has been described as a freak occurrence, taking place in-bounds at The Canyons resort.
Two people were swept away: 30-year-old Jesse Williams hit a tree and died. An 11-year-old boy survived. The area had just recently been opened. The resort said there were no indications it was unstable.
Mike Goar, of The Canyons, said at the time, ""Conditions can change sometimes by the minute, and we felt good about it again, the fact it was open for skiing yesterday, the stability of that general area, and it was OK to be opened.""
Then on Christmas, a second slide and a second death. This time 53-year-old Dave Balls was snowmobiling with his family when a wall of snow buried him near Thousand Peaks Recreation Park.
Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds said, ""I actually know the individual very well and know the family. It's very difficult for me personally, [to be] the bearer of such bad tidings.""
Avalanche danger in the Western Uintahs is just below extreme right now. The Wastach Mountains are almost as dangerous.
Just one more reminder to be prepared and know the conditions before you head out.",

Desert News
Authorities are warning of increased avalanche danger as more storms move across Utah.
It comes as the second avalanche fatality of the week struck in the backcountry near Oakley, in Summit County. Authorities said 53-year-old Dave Balls was snowmobiling in an area known as the Super Bowl on the east side of Windy Beak in the Whitney Basin area on Tuesday when he died in an avalanche.
""He was buried for over an hour and a half,"" the Utah Avalanche Center said in a statement on its Web site Wednesday. ""He was not wearing a beacon and was found with an organized probe line.""
Authorities were expected to investigate the cause of the slide today. The Utah Avalanche Center said the slide was as much as 400 feet wide and 4 feet deep.
""Wind loading on a weak faceted snowpack is the most likely structure,"" the Web site utahavalanchecenter.com said.
Balls' family released a statement Wednesday saying David was snowmobiling with his sons in an area they were all familiar with. Balls and his sons were ""very experienced"" snowmobilers, the statement said.
He was the founder and owner of Valley Ready Mix, which he ran with his brother-in-law Brent Baker.
Balls is the second person to die in an avalanche this week. An 11-year-old boy is making a remarkable recovery after he was buried for 33 minutes in an avalanche on Sunday.
Max Zilvitis was one of three skiers trapped in an avalanche on an inbounds trail at The Canyons. Jesse R. Williams, 30, of Grand Junction, Colo. died of head trauma when the slide carried him into a tree. Zilvitis and his father, Brian, were also caught in the slide.
""A man and a child below were engulfed, with the man partially buried and the child totally buried,"" according to a report from the Avalanche Forecast Center.
""The father was able to dig himself out while his son remained completely buried. The ski patrol arrived and performed an outstanding rescue. They set up a probe line using volunteers on the scene. Within minutes, there was a strike by a 15-year-old girl that was on the probe line that the snow safety had organized, and the boy was excavated from the debris with no pulse or respirations.""
Monday afternoon Max regained consciousness and has made dramatic improvement each day. Wednesday, Primary Children's Medical Center listed him in good condition and said he had been taken out of intensive care.
Brian and Samantha Zilvitis, of Park City, released a statement Wednesday about their son's recovery.

More snowmobilers getting caught in avalanches
December 26th, 2007 @ 6:02pm
 John Hollenhorst reporting 
More snow fell today, and more is in the forecast, all adding to the danger of an avalanche season that has killed two people in the past few days.
The most recent fatality is David Balls of Oakley. He died yesterday while snowmobiling in the mountains above that town. That death highlights a strong trend that's taken place over the last 30 years: Snowmobiling has replaced backcountry skiing as the leading cause of fatal avalanches.
A lot of people feel very powerful when they're on a snowmobile, but they are no match for the power of nature when snow starts to slide. Backcountry skiers have learned the hard way for many years. In recent years, snowmobilers have been forced to learn the same lessons.
 

A safety video put together by the Utah Avalanche Center shows that winter sports can be exhilarating, spectacular and terrifying. ""Getting caught in an avalanche is kind of like being in a car wreck. I mean you just don't want to be in one,"" one skier says.
Daredevil backcountry skiers and mountain climbers used to be the recreationists most at risk. But since the 1980s, avalanches are increasingly a phenomenon of snowmobiles.
""It used to be snowmobiles couldn't get back into areas that normally people could hike or ski into,"" explained Eric Stucki, of Utah State Parks and Recreation.
New powerful machines now routinely go where angels fear to tread.
For a half century, avalanche deaths have been steadily increasing. Over time, the death rates have shifted. Skier and climber deaths have declined, relatively, while snowmobiler deaths have shot up to about 40 percent of all avalanche deaths.
 

Experts now stress avalanche training and equipment--probe poles, locater beacons, and shovels--for all backcountry snowmobilers, and the safety gear ought to be on the rider, not the machine, in case they get separated.
""They're just kind of on the back side of the learning curve a little bit maybe,"" Brett Kobernick, of the Utah Avalanche Center, said. ""They're kind of in the same boat that skiers and snowboarders were 10 or 15 years ago.""
The goal, of course, is to never have to use avalanche tools, to avoid going into areas when they're dangerous. ""As long as you check the forecast, as long as you know before you go, I think they can go back into those areas, as long as they are prepared,"" Stucki said.
In other words, get information so you know when to go and when to stay home. ""Keep in contact with what the current conditions are, and that way they can make wise and informed decisions when they travel into the backcountry,"" Kobernick said.
The Utah Avalanche Center now provides forecasts specifically tailored to snowmobilers, and they do educational programs for all sorts of different groups.
The experts Eyewitness News talked to say the message is sinking in, and snowmobilers are much more safety conscious than they used to be.

OAKLEY, Utah, Dec. 26 (UPI) -- A father of six was killed in a 400-foot-wide avalanche in Summit County, Utah, the second victim of a local avalanche this week.
Bishop Howard Sorensen, a local religious leader, said Dave Balls, 53, was snowmobiling with his four sons when he was unable to avoid the avalanche and was lost in a wave of snow, The Salt Lake Tribune reported Wednesday.
""He was up enjoying the day when the slide broke loose,"" Sorensen said of accident Tuesday. ""He just wasn't able to out run (it).""
Along with his four sons, who managed to avoid the avalanche, Balls had two adopted daughters from Russia, the Tribune said.
The newspaper said that Balls' death came in the wake of last weekend's avalanche in Summit County that claimed the life of 30-year-old Colorado native Jesse R. Williams. In addition to killing Williams, Sunday's avalanche at the Canyons ski resort also critically injured an 11-year-old boy.

A man was killed and a boy critically injured Sunday morning when an avalanche swept over them while they skied within the bounds of The Canyons Resort. It was the first death of the avalanche season. The skiers were in the Red Pine Chutes area when the avalanche began just after 11:15 a.m., said resort spokeswoman Elizabeth Dowd. The man - 25 to 35 years old and possibly a Colorado resident - was found about 10 minutes later, but died at the scene, she said. A friend of the man suffered minor injuries. The 11-year-old was skiing at the bottom of the double black-diamond run with his father when he was caught up in the slide, Summit County sheriff's Capt. Andrew Leatham said. Three women witnessed the avalanche; one found the boy about 30 minutes later with her ski pole. Rescuers performed CPR, and the boy was flown to Primary Children's Medical Center, Leatham said. As of late Sunday afternoon, the boy was in intensive care and doctors were warming his core temperature, he said. The slide occurred within resort boundaries, in an area that had opened Saturday, Dowd said. Explosives, a snow pack assessment and a test ski had been administered at the avalanche site less than a day before the slide, she said. ""Aggressive avalanche control work had been performed at The Canyons throughout the week as new snow fell,"" she said. Investigators didn't know what triggered the slide, which was 125 feet wide and 500 feet long. The depth ranged from 3 inches to 5 feet. Avalanche deaths are ""very rare"" in ski resorts, said Brett Kobernik, forecaster for the Utah Avalanche Center. ""It's only happened a handful of times since the resorts have opened here,"" he said. The avalanche danger in the area Sunday was considerable, according to the center, which warned that dangerous human-triggered slides were likely. The risk was expected to remain today, Kobernik said. ""The avalanche danger will be on the rise again on the back country . . . due to more snow and stronger winds,"" he said.

Man killed, boy injured in avalanche at The Canyons


By Rebecca Palmer
Deseret News

Published: Sunday, Dec. 23, 2007 7:40 p.m. MST

 

An avalanche at The Canyons resort in Park City left one man dead and a juvenile critically injured late Sunday morning.
The avalanche at the ski resort occurred at 11:17 a.m., according to the Summit County Sheriff's Office. Skiers who saw the crash and Canyons ski patrol teams were on the scene within minutes. Sheriff's deputies also were called to the area of the slide.
Eight minutes after the avalanche, the body of a man between the ages of 25 and 30 was found. Paramedics immediately began attempting resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.
Twenty-five minutes after the first man was found, an adolescent boy was discovered and pulled from the snow and ice. He was unconscious but later was revived and taken to a Salt Lake area hospital, said Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds. Sunday night he was reported in critical but stable condition.
Neither the identity nor the hometown of either person was released Sunday evening, pending family notification, Edmunds said. Police did not believe Sunday that the two had any relation to one another.
The man and boy were found within bounds near the Red Pine Chutes area, according to The Canyons spokeswoman Elizabeth Dowd. Officials are unsure whether the avalanche, which they called of substantial size, started within bounds.
The Canyons has participated in aggressive avalanche control in the area of Sunday's slide, Dowd said. Explosives and other safety measures were performed within 24 hours of the fatal avalanche.
However, the Utah Avalanche Center has listed slide danger in the area of the western Uintas as considerable. The center does not list specific data for The Canyons on its Web site at www.avalanche.org.
Sunday's fatal slide caused The Canyons resort's second death within just eight days. On Dec. 17, a Park City attorney died after striking a tree and breaking his neck near the Lower Crowning Glory run at the resort.
So far in winter 2007, Utah has seen three injury-causing avalanche accidents. according to the avalanche center. The first two occurred Dec. 13 at Pioneer Ridge and Hidden Canyon, both in the Salt Lake area.
In the 2006-2007 winter season, Utah had seven injury-causing avalanches. At least 10 people were hurt in locations ranging from Ogden to the Uintas to Salt Lake City. Utah also had five injury-causing avalanches in the previous winter season and nine the year before.
Avalanche experts recommend that skiers, snowmobilers and snowboarders learn about the dangers of slides before hitting the slopes. They also recommend carrying safety gear such as beacons, probes, shovels and a lightweight backpack. Most avalanche victims have only 15 minutes to live after being buried in snow, according to the avalanche center.",

After waiting at the car for some time, the remaining two called 911 to initiate a search. A helicopter with personnel using night vision goggles verified tracks going into an avalanche high on the peak with none coming out. The body recovery efforts by both Salt Lake Country Search and Rescue and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue began the following morning. The three Norwegians were all wearing rescue gear and had called the avalanche forecast that morning. The Utah Avalanche Center had rated the danger as “CONSIDERABLE on slopes steeper than about 35 degrees facing northwest through northeast through southeast, where dangerous avalanches 1 to 3 feet deep can be triggered by people.” The forecaster, weary of the three previous fatalities that week, implored people to “Back off the steep stuff – if the close calls continue, someone else is going to get killed or hurt.” 
The winds were too strong for a helicopter evacuation so members from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, Wasatch Powderbird Guides, and the Salt Lake County Sheriff brought the body down Butler Fork to the Big Cottonwood highway.

A father and his two sons were skiing at Snowbasin resort. Later in the day, they headed out-of-bounds into the Hell’s Canyon area, an area north of Snowbasin where avalanche hazard is not mitigated with explosives, nor patrolled. Their objective was to ski powder. The group had little or no avalanche training and had no rescue gear. While descending, the sons skied ahead of their father and got separated. The details are not clear, but a slide was triggered and Brian Schwartz the seventeen year-old son was caught in the slide. Brian was swept approximately 1500 vertical feet down the slope and was buried. He had significant trauma to his face and head and appeared to have died of trauma. Brian’s father and other bother arrived at the site some time after the slide had happened. They found one of Brian’s skis and continued to look for him around the area. Soon afterwards two snowboarders arrived and saw what had happened. They also found a helmet and liner below the toe of the debris. They immediately came to dispatch to report the incident. The father and brother were also brought to dispatch shortly after.

Rescue:
Ski Patrol dispatched an initial response task force. This was made up of two teams; the first team came in from above; 3 pros and one dog. A second team came in from below via snowmobile and foot; two pros and a dog. The first team arrived and searched the pile with beacons, Reccos, dog and spot probing. The second team arrived and also searched with dog and spot probing. After the initial search came up negative a first column was dispatched from the top. This included 4 pros with avalanche rescue gear. When the first column arrived a probe line was started. After probing for nearly an hour a strike was made and Brian’s body was recovered approximately 6 feet under. Although he appeared dead rescue efforts were taken until a life flight helicopter could host the body back to the base of Snowbasin. All patrollers returned to the based area without further incident.

Most of them were wearing avalanche rescue gear, though those details are still being sifted through. Many clues to instability were missed along the way, including natural avalanches close to the accident site. In addition, at least one large hard slab avalanche was triggered without incident, about a ¼ mile north of the accident site prior to the fatality. This slide was 2’-3’ deep, 250’ wide, running about 150’ vertically. It most likely emboldened the group, luring them deeper into the avalanche dragons den. This group was very familiar with the terrain and had triggered small avalanches in the area on past outings.
Around 16:00 the group traveled to the southwest of the avalanche they just triggered and regrouped at the bottom of a south facing slope. Several riders climbed the 32 degree slope above them without incident. Sixteen year old Zachary Holmes began climbing the slope too, but when he neared the top, he began “side-hilling” towards a steeper adjacent slope which had more of an easterly aspect. As he changed aspect and slope angle, he triggered a large hard slab avalanche 2’-4’ deep and 300’-325’ wide.
His partners turned their beacons on to receive and began searching. There was plenty of confusion and several random holes were dug 75’ uphill from where Zachary was finally located, buried 3’ under his snowmobile which was sticking out of the snow. After he was found, two young men stayed on the scene and began CPR while a male and female rode back to the trailhead to make a cell phone call and alert local authorities. Much to their dismay their phones didn’t work at the trailhead, but a family with an “OnStar” system in the vehicle placed a call and Wasatch County Search and Rescue was dispatched.

The accident happened in a popular snowmobiling area of rolling hills with short, slopes. The victim was highmarking a slope when he triggered the avalanche.

They were separated at the time of the accident. The two others did not think anything about the fact that they were separated, they just figured Michael took a different route. They returned to an area where Micheal should have shown up. When he didn’t, they knew something was wrong.

Both the victim and his snowmobile were completely buried. Companions at the scene called for a rescue, but before rescuers could arrive, they randomly dug the search area, which was fairly small—70 x 30 feet.

We still have not talked directly to the witness so we are missing some information on the accident. What we do know is that two people left the Snowbasin ski area Saturday, March 11th and headed into Taylor Canyon. Both of them were snowboarding and neither of them had avalanche rescue equipment. At around 3 pm one or both of them triggered an avalanche that caught one of them and buried him. It broke about 15’ above them. The person that was not caught searched for about an hour starting in some trees just down the slope from the fracture line which was the last place he saw the victim. The witness continued down the avalanche path with no luck locating the victim then continued out the drainage into Ogden where he alerted authorities. A helicopter was dispatched to survey the area and avalanche workers were able to locate the avalanche along with a few others that had run as well.

Efforts were organized early Sunday morning but weather did not permit a snow safety team to do control work on slopes that had the potential to avalanche onto the area where the search party would be. Lees and Kobernik along with G.R. of the Snowbasin patrol attempted to travel to the fracture line. Unstable snow and very radical terrain kept them from doing this safely so the mission was aborted. Some clearing was taking place by late Sunday and avalanche control work was performed. Explosives did produce avalanching that covered the initial debris pile. The initial search party was dispatched but unable to locate the victim. The Weber County Sheriff had closed the Taylor Canyon access from Snowbasin until the search is done so that potential skiers above the rescue party don’t put them in danger. On Sunday the witness was questioned by the search teams and it was determined to conduct a search in the trees near the starting zone which was the last place the victim was seen.

Many people consider backcountry terrain adjacent to ski resorts to be an extension of the ski resort with the same dangers as within the area boundary. Often, they ski in this terrain regularly and take for granted that the snowpack receives no avalanche control work and does not see the same amount of skier compaction as within the ski area. Since they are familiar with this terrain, it is difficult for them to pass it up when there is fresh snow to ski. However, this terrain has a backcountry snowpack where new weakness and persistent weakness can exist even though it is so close to the resort.",

Body found may be missing snowshoer 

NATALIE EVANS - Daily Herald 

Utah County searchers believe they have found the body of missing snowshoer Marshall Higgins.

A search-and-rescue plane passing over the Primrose Cirque area on Mount Timpanogos Friday reported seeing clothing partially buried in the snow. The clothing items are consistent with those reportedly worn by Higgins, though no positive identification of the body has been made. 

Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Dennis Harris said a search-and-rescue plane has been flying over the area every three days, weather permitting, since an avalanche on Dec. 31, 2005, buried Higgins, 31, of Salt Lake City. 

After spotting the clothing, search and rescue efforts were organized for Friday afternoon. Harris said the body was three to four miles away from the Aspen Grove area.

When searchers arrived at the body, they used ice picks and shovels to dig a hole 12 feet in circumference and 7 feet deep through three layers of ice, according to a Utah County press release. 

They reported that each layer of ice was 2-6 inches deep. 

Before searchers could take the body down the mountain, a thunderstorm suspended the search, the release stated. They decided to spend the night on the mountain with the body, which was fitted for transport on a stokes litter. 

The body is ready for Life Flight, and searchers hope the helicopter will be able to take the body off the mountain today, the release said. 

Searchers have been looking for Higgins since the avalanche. Searches days after the incident had to be called off because of weather and potential avalanche danger to rescuers. 

Searches organized in the spring were called off because of too much snow in the area, though searchers have hiked through the area looking for Higgins since the snow started melting. 

They have not identified the body yet, but there are no other missing persons reported to be in the area, Harris said.

Salt Lake man presumed dead in avalanche 

Search suspended: A Salt Lake City man is presumed dead, but a missing teen is found near Snowbird 

By Jason Bergreen 

The Salt Lake Tribune

Salt Lake Tribune 

ASPEN GROVE - Just before Marshall Higgins headed out for a snowshoeing excursion into the high mountains east of Provo, Jeff Frederick took a photo of his friend in the pre-dawn darkness of Aspen Grove. 

On Sunday, that photo was tacked to the inside wall of a Utah County sheriff's mobile command center as helicopters waited to get to the mountainside where Higgins had been swept away in an avalanche on Saturday. By midafternoon, authorities told Higgins' family that the search had been deemed a search and recovery, not a search and rescue. A short time later, weather and snow conditions forced temporary cancellation of the search. 

Earlier, Higgins' brother Adam Higgins, said the family was aware that change in the status of the search meant Higgins likely had died. ""It was disheartening but expected,"" he said. ''We're so grateful Jeff came out of it.'' 

Higgins, 31, and Frederick, both of Salt Lake City, had hiked for more than five hours to an altitude of about 10,300 feet near Hidden Lakes when the slide engulfed them. Frederick was able to ride it out, clutching a tree to stop. He searched for his friend, then used his cell phone to call for help. A Utah Department of Safety helicopter plucked him to safety at about 4:30 p.m. Saturday. 

Also on Sunday, a 16-year-old California boy who had gone missing in an out-of-bounds area of Snowbird ski resort was found alive and in good condition at about 11:20 a.m. 

Snowbird spokeswoman Laura Schaffer said the boy built a snow cave in Mineral Basin, in the north fork of American Fork Canyon, and emerged at about 10 a.m. Sunday and flagged down a search helicopter. 

""He was a smart kid, and the clear weather today, those were the saving graces in this situation,"" she said. The boy's parents declined to release their and their son's names and hometown, she said. 

In the search for Higgins on Sunday, Wasatch Powderbird Guides dropped 29 explosive charges to knock loose any potential avalanches before search crews were to be flown in. But shifting winds and intermittent cloud cover forced authorities to call off the search, and Utah County Sheriff James Tracy said forecasts of another storm system meant it would not resume today. 

Tracy said weather and conditions would determine when the search would continue. 

Higgins' brothers described him as a sociable guy who made friends easily. An experienced snowshoer and outdoorsman, he had ventured into the area several times in years past, his brother Brandon Higgins said. This was his first foray there this winter; Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Darren Gilbert said Saturday neither man had an avalanche beacon on this trip. 

Frederick declined to speak to reporters Sunday at Aspen Grove. 

Higgins is survived by his wife, Kelly, and daughters Hannah, 3, and 2-year-old Emilee. 

His presumed death is the first this season. By this time last year, four people had died in avalanches, and a total of eight would perish, making that season one of the deadliest since records have been kept. 

Saturday's avalanche was near where three men died on Dec. 26, 2003. They were among a group of five who were swept down as they snowboarded in the Roberts Horn Chute of Aspen Grove, about 2 1/2 miles north of Sundance Ski Resort. 

The California boy apparently slipped through two rope barriers at about 1:30 p.m. Saturday to get to the out-of-bounds backcountry, Snowbird's Schaffer said Sunday. He was reported missing about 4 p.m., and the ski patrol and dogs searched for him until 11:30 p.m., when conditions were deemed too unsafe, Schaffer said. 

During that time, the boy carved out a snow cave for refuge, she said, adding that he had heard snowcats about 100 yards away at about 10 p.m. that night but was ""too tired"" to flag them down. The boy slept in the cave through the night, awakening at 10 a.m. Sunday to the sound of a helicopter. He waved to it and was rescued about 90 minutes later. 

The boy and his parents had been skiing and boarding, but when he went missing he was with some cousins, Schaffer said. 

Salt Lake County sheriff's Sgt. Todd Griffiths said the boy would not be penalized for leaving the resort's boundaries. ''He basically got lost, went off a small hill and got in an area where he felt he could not hike out,'' he said. 

In all, the ski patrol, Wasatch Powerbird Guides and representatives of five counties - Salt Lake, Weber, Utah, Davis and Wasatch, contributed to the two searches.

On Thursday March 31st a group of five snowmobilers left the Monte Cristo trailhead, located near Ogden, Utah, for a day of snowmobiling. The terrain is relatively benign and is an area many locals go to when there is an avalanche danger on nearby steep, climbing hills. The group was very familiar with the terrain and was thinking about the avalanche conditions, and they were all wearing beacons, shovels, and probes.  Four of the riders stopped on top of a slope just to the south of “Whiskey Hill”. The fifth sledder and avalanche victim passed by them, and much to everyone’s surprise began descending a steep adjacent slope to the south, named Eccles Peak. 
The snowmobiler was only about 20’ onto the slope when he propagated a large avalanche. 

Rescue Summery:
One of the members of the party drove to the top of the slope, got off his machine and ran down the bed surface while the rest of the party approached from the bottom of the slope. Within a matter of minutes the fellow descending the slope pinpointed the victim in a tight group of trees and within 7 or 8 minutes the party had the victim dug out.

Tragically, a 27 year-old snowmobiler from Farr West died after triggering this avalanche on the last day of March. He is the 8th person to die in an avalanche in the Utah backcountry this season.
 
 
 
The deadly avalanche occurred on a steep wind-drifted slope just south of the slope known as ""Whiskey Hill."" ""Whiskey Hill"" is on Eccles Peak off the snow-covered Curtis Creek Road, and because hwy 39 is closed in the winter, it is accessible for snowmobilers from either Monte Cristo trail-head (west side near Huntsville and east side near Woodruff). 
 
 
  
 The slope that avalanched is just a little steeper than Whiskey Hill, (the tracked slope on the right or to the north). It faces just a little more north, it's shallower and it may have picked up a bit more wind-deposited snow. 
 
 
 
 
The hard slab avalanche was over 500 feet wide and averaged 4 feet deep at the crown. The short slope is very steep ( 38 to 45 degrees in slope steepness).
Utah Avalanche Center forecaster, Craig Gordon, has to kick his boot toes into the solid bed-surface in route to the crown.
 
 
 
 
 The northeast facing slope at just under 9000' in elevation is a classic avalanche trap. Prevailing winds drift tons of snow from a large open flat area to the west of the slope and deposit it here as they decelerate. It is a perfect lee-slope fetch area.
 
 
 
 
 To make matters worse, snow sliding off this slope runs smack into, and then strains through a wall of mature conifers. The unlucky snowmobiler probably died from massive trauma inflicted by the trees as he was pushed through them by the avalanche.
 
 
 
 Craig Gordon examines the mechanical properties of the avalanche by digging above the crown. Up there he can test snow that is undisturbed by the avalanche. It's important for us to look at avalanches. We compare what we find in the crown profile of the avalanche path to the snow profiles of slopes in the region that haven't avalanched. Is there a similar combination of a stiff slab and a thin sugary weak layer? If so, we must suspect that other human triggered avalanches are possible.
 
 
 
The stiff wind-deposited slab failed on a thin sugary or faceted layer capped by a dirty wind-crust in early March. The rest of the solid slab consists of snow deposited in the last 2 big March storms (3/20-2/23 and 3/28-3/30).
 
 
 
 The cornice above shows us that wind deposited snow builds up on the slope below. Prevailing winds scour snow off an expansive flat open ridge-top and can rapidly deposit tons of snow onto this steep northeast facing slope.
 
 
 A single track descending into the middle of the avalanche tells the story. A snowmobiler rode past his party and down the steep slope. The avalanche released when he was about 20' into it, right at a steep rocky roll-over where the remaining snow is shallow and weak. The track enters the slide path in the center, and the slab pulled out a couple hundred feet on either side.
 
 
 He might have been able to ride out the avalanche if it were on an open slope, but instead he was driven into an unforgiving grove. These trees are directly in the fall-line below the tracks leading into the avalanche.
 
 
 
 Tons of snow strained through the trees and piled up deeply around them. This is looking up at the crown from near the burial site.
 
 
 
 
 Here is the burial site in a large pile of snow on the downhill side of these trees. Given the situation, the rider was found quickly by his party who were all equipped with beacons, probes and shovels. Even so, he died, most likely as a result of trauma. Statistics show that at least a quarter (or 25%) of avalanche fatalities can be blamed on trauma. Many die before the avalanche even stops.

A group of five out-of-state snowboarders went to the Canyons Resort for the day and they rode to the top of the Peak 9990. They saw the nearby slopes of Dutch Draw with several dozen ski and snowboard tracks in it and noticed several other parties hiking into the area. Although most of the party members had beacons and shovels in their cars, they did not bring them that day because they did not plan to go into the backcountry. Two of the party members had taken a level I avalanche class. The party knew about the avalanche danger because they discussed it at length the previous night. They decided to go into the backcountry that day because it looked like a number of other people were doing it without incident.
They hiked the 200 yards to the top of Peak 9990 and left from the backcountry access gate, which is clearly marked with several signs warning of the danger. To leave the boundary, one must push open a gate with a large, white sign attached showing a skull and crossbones marked in large letters “You May Die”. It is legal to access the backcountry, which National Forest, but the Canyons Resorts wants to make sure everyone knows that there is no avalanche control beyond their rope lines. They hiked south along the ridge about a half mile to the top of Dutch Draw. On the way, they passed one avalanche path that had dozens of tracks in it and they went to the next path locally known as “Conehead” because of its shape from a distance. They hiked to the high point, which had only a few tracks in it and decided that it was too dangerous and they backtracked to an area where the slope angle is gentler and they could utilize an island of thick conifer trees to safely get down into the upper third of the slope.
They descended through the island of trees and they planned to enter the slope from the side by passing beneath a vertical cliff band. One snowboarderentered the slope below the cliff and Shane Maixner, 27, decided to jump off the lower portion of the cliff onto the slope—a drop of about 20 feet. He appeared to trigger the avalanche when he landed and he was engulfed in the slide. The first snowboarder managed to escape off the nearby flank of the avalanche.
	
Rescue Summary:
The group of snowboarders descended the avalanche bed surface and began probing with tree branches for their friend. They also called 911 on their cell phone and ski patrol from the Canyons Resort responded within about 20 minutes. After rescuers determined that the party did not have beacons and that they did not get any beacon signals from the rest of the debris, they decided that conditions were too dangerous to put a larger group of rescuers onto the slope. They escorted the remaining four snowboarders out of the area and Wasatch Powderbird Guides dropped explosives onto the upper part of the avalanche path. They triggered the next slope to the north with another large, hard slab avalanche, which was not quite as large as the original slide, but they did not trigger any hangfire above the original avalanche.  
The Summit County Sheriff took over the rescue and brought in a larger team from the Summit County Search and Rescue along with personnel from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue. They used avalanche rescue dogs and probes. They finally found the body of Shane Maixner two days after the accident, buried four feet deep in a grove of trees on the extreme north edge of the avalanche path.  
It proved very difficult to know how many people were caught in the slide because of widely conflicting witness accounts. The original party of snowboarders reported that they believed that they were alone in the bowl. They did not notice any one else. Three other parties, however, reported other people in the bowl. First, a party at the top of the slope was video taping the scenery from the ridge when they heard the roar of the avalanche. When they looked over the edge and continued to video the slide. The tape, reportedly, was of poor quality and inconclusive about other parties in the bowl. Second, two snowboarders were building jumps on the flats below just to the north of the avalanche runout and they were adamant that they saw others on the slope and were able to give descriptions of clothing and exact locations. Third, a party hiking up to the backcountry access point from the top of the 9990 lift claimed to see a lone skier going across the flats at the bottom, who was overcome by the slide.
Since many of the people who ski at the Canyons Resort are on vacation, it was very difficult to know who was missing at the end of the day. In fact, it took until January 17th—three days after the accident, to whittle the list down. The Summit County Sheriff announced that there was likely only one fatality and he called off the search. 
Media interest was intense because the some witnesses to the avalanche initially indicated that there may have been 15 people buried. On the heels of the large mudslides in California, the national media arrived in droves and it became headline news across the country and the lead story in many of the television news programs for the next several days.",,,1,"Media Reports:
This accident captured the national media attention and numerous articles appeared in many of the nations newspapers as well as being headline news on most of the national television stations. There are far too many article to include here, but this is a sample of an article as the search came to a close.

Sheriff: Only 1 slide death 
Search for more avalanche victims is called off 
By Lisa Rosetta
					The Salt Lake Tribune
					Salt Lake Tribune 
 
PARK CITY - An exhausting four-day search for victims of a massive avalanche near The Canyons ski resort is over. Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds said Shane Maixner, 27, who was found Sunday beneath 4 feet of snow, is probably the only person who perished.
					 Investigators have whittled a list of overdue or missing people to three, but Edmunds said he is doubtful they were caught in the avalanche, which Maixner is believed to have triggered.
					 Searchers began scouring the steep slope just after 1 p.m. Friday without knowing how many people they were looking for, although they believed as many as five were caught in the avalanche, according to eyewitness accounts.
					 As of Monday, however, there was no compelling evidence to suggest there were more victims, the sheriff said.
					 Witness accounts of what happened may have been ""clouded"" by the fear they experienced as they watched the disaster unfold, he said.
					 ""They all saw something different, and this is not atypical of a situation like this.""
					 Edmunds said the search ""could ramp back up if we get further information.""
					 Maixner's death brought Utah's 2004-05 avalanche season fatality total to seven, the most since 1950, when officials began tracking avalanche deaths.
					 While searchers uncovered pieces of clothing not belonging to Maixner, they believe the scattered, miscellaneous items may have been left there over time, by other skiers.
					 The number of searchers probing the 30-foot deep avalanche Monday was about a third the size of the crew that assembled Saturday. They navigated through bulky, debris-littered terrain in dangerous avalanche conditions, and by late Monday were fatigued, Edmunds said.
					 At the top of the Ninety Nine 90 Express ski lift Monday, which opened to the public for the first time since the avalanche occurred, skiers and snowboarders gawked at the devastation from behind a temporarily erected rope boundary. Ski patrol members explained to the curious onlookers that their presence on the mountain could trigger additional slides, putting the searchers' lives in peril.
					 By dusk Monday, only a few Red Cross workers lingered at the command center at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Park City to stack up chairs and break down tables
					 ""This has been a huge ordeal,"" Edmunds said. ""There have been a lot of people who have helped us through this.""
					 The tab for the search, which is in the tens of thousands of dollars, will be jointly paid for by Summit County and the state, the sheriff said.
					 An accident report issued Monday by the U.S. Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center says there was some initial agreement that a snowboarder ""launched over a cliff, triggering the massive slide that engulfed him and an unknown number of others that were either on the same slope or in the runout below.""
					 Though the report does not mention Maixner by name, it says the snowboarder's body was recovered Sunday.

Avalanches kill 2 men in Sanpete 
Ideal slide conditions: Dense snow, strong winds and warming are making the backcountry dangerous

Two men died in avalanches in Sanpete County on Saturday, the latest victims of what has become an unusually dangerous season in Utah's backcountry.
 Garrett Luke Gordan of Ephraim was snowboarding at about 1 p.m. when he was swept up in an avalanche near the top of Ephraim Canyon, said Andy Lyon, a Sanpete County Sheriff's Office sergeant. 
 Gordan, who was carrying an avalanche beacon, was buried for about a half hour before friends dug him out. They administered CPR until Sanpete County searchers arrived and called in a Life Flight helicopter. The 26-year-old was flown to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo where he was pronounced dead.
 An hour later, a snowmobiler was buried in an avalanche east of Mount Pleasant in the Choke Cherry Ridge area, Lyon said. David Wayne Johnson, 42, of South Jordan, was dug out by searchers and flown to Sanpete Valley Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
 Craig Gordon, an avalanche forecaster at the U.S. Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center, said this winter is shaping up to be an unusual - and deadly - season for avalanches. Six people have perished in slides so far this winter, equaling the death toll of 2000-2001, according to Avalanche Center records. 
 ""This is an unusual weather pattern, and unusual weather tends to produce unusual avalanches,"" Gordon said. A steady stream of storms in the region have brought high winds, heavy snowfall and fluctuating temperatures - ""the perfect recipe for a slab avalanche,"" he said.
 On Saturday, the mountains were blasted with winds up to 100 mph and between 6 and 8 inches of snow was forecast that night, said Bruce Tremper, director of the Avalanche Center. 
 ""It's kind of a 'triple whammy,' as we call it,"" he said. ""We get snow, dense and heavy, extremely strong winds and warming temperatures. People without good avalanche skills should definitely avoid the backcountry.""
 Avalanche danger continues to be high for all Utah mountains, even for low-elevation terrain, Tremper said. 
 While snow, rain and wind pelted other parts of Utah, Saturday in the Salt Lake Valley was sunny and dry. Though strong southerly winds whipped through parts of Salt Lake City on Friday night and Saturday, the majority of a large West Coast storm wasn't expected to produce snow in the valley until after midnight.
 ""The main storm itself is somewhat stationary along the West Coast,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Tardy said.
 Several inches of snow fell Saturday afternoon in Logan, Price and Heber, Tardy said. Alta Ski Resort has received about 18 inches of new snow since Friday, 6 of which fell Saturday, he said. 
 Winds gusting 30 to 40 mph were recorded in Salt Lake County, with some gusts reaching as high as 49 mph at the airport, Tardy said. High winds reaching up to 90 mph continued blowing in areas of the Wasatch Mountains.
 Snow in Salt Lake City could turn to light rain today with temperatures reaching the mid 40s. More rain was expected Monday, with snow returning to the valley Tuesday, Tardy said.

Avalanches Kill Two in Central Utah
Jan. 8, 2005 
Sam Penrod reporting 
Another deadly weekend in Utah's backcountry, as two avalanches kill two people in Central Utah. The slides both happened in Sanpete County Saturday afternoon, about an hour apart. 
It's been a tragic day in Sanpete County. Two men were killed in separate slides, while snowboarding and snowmobiling this afternoon. 
In the mountains east of Mt. Pleasant, a group of snowmobilers were in the area, when one of them apparently triggered an avalanche, around 2:00 this afternoon. One person was buried in the slide, but those in the group eventually were able to dig the victim out. But he could not be revived. 
Saturday evening, volunteers from the Sanpete County Search and Rescue were able to recover the victim from the avalanche. 
Sheriff Kay Larsen/ Sanpete County Sheriff's Office: ""There was approximately ten people up there snowmobiling together. They had lost sight of him and could see the tracks where it had slid, and went down there. [They were] able to get him out of the snow, but unable to revive him."" 
About an hour before the Mt. Pleasant slide, a 26 year old man who was snowboarding got caught in an avalanche in Ephraim Canyon. The victim was buried in the slide, but was wearing an avalanche beacon and someone who was with him was able to dig him out and started CPR. 
The victim was airlifted to Utah Valley Medical Center where he died. 
Tonight authorities are identifying the victim as 26 year old Louk Gordon from Ephraim. And in the Mt. Pleasant slide, 42 year old David Wayne Johnson of South Jordan was killed. 
Authorities say heavy snow earlier in the week and then the warmer temperatures today likely caused both slides. 
Avalanche Warning 
Those fatalities make five avalanche-related deaths in the last month. 
Another smaller avalanche-- about 4-feet deep-- has closed the road up Little Cottonwood Canyon. Authorities are telling everyone to get out. An avalanche warning is in effect for ALL Utah mountains, and that warning will remain in effect for the rest of the weekend.

Two snowshoers were reported as overdue when they failed to return from a walk up Mineral Fork on Saturday, December 11th. Victim are Bruce Quint, 59, and Melvin Dennis, 37, both from Salt Lake City. 
	
Rescue Summary:
Saturday night, two skiers from Salt Lake Country Search and Rescue followed snowshoe tracks to the base of a large headwall at the upper end of Mineral Fork where the tracks disappear under fresh avalanche debris and did not appear again on the other side. The two snowshoers were the first people to travel up Mineral Fork after the large storm, which ended two days earlier. Searchers could find no beacon signals in the debris, nor visual clues. Neither of the victims wore beacons. In consultation with several avalanche experts, including one who flew over the area in a helicopter that night, they decided that conditions were too dangerous to bring in a larger team of searchers that night. 
On Sunday morning personnel from Wasatch Powderbird Guides controlled the area with explosives, which triggered widespread avalanches in remainder of the canyon as well as hang fire above the accident site. They flew teams of rescuers to the site including Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue, Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, a volunteer group of ski area personnel operating under the Salt Lake County Sheriff. The helicopter was from Utah Highway Patrol. They searched the area using trained avalanche rescue dogs and probed areas where the dogs indicated interest. At 11:30, they found Melvin Dennis buried about four feet deep and more-or-less in line with the tracks which entered the debris. They found the second victim Bruce Quint, on Monday, December 13, 2004 around 10:00 am about 25 yards uphill from the first victim and buried over eight feet deep. Both victims appeared to have been simply pushed over by the debris and buried without being tumbled and were probably buried fairly near their initial positions.",,,2,PHOTOS: See Photos.,

Two males had been snowmobiling in the upper Trout Creek drainage. They decided to go to a slope very familiar to them. At around 11:30 they arrived at the base of the slope. They decided the more experienced of the two, who was wearing a beacon and did have a shovel, would attempt to climb the slope first. About mid way up, he got his machine stuck. He worked on it for a while, got hot and took off his helmet. While he was trying to get unstuck his partner, who had no rescue gear, climbed an adjacent slope. His intention was to get high enough on the slope in order to ride down to the stuck machine and assist in the excavation. As the witness got to the top of a bench he saw the crown start to propagate on the same slope the victim was on. The witness realized a large avalanche had been triggered. He circled back around to find no sign of the victim.
Rescue Summary:
The witness rode his machine to a nearby ridge and called 911. He also flagged down 3 or 4 riders to help him with the search. They followed him back and began probing likely areas with broken branches. The witness then jumped back on his machine and climbed another ridge and flagged down two riders who had beacons, shovels, and probes. They returned to the scene and found the victim within 5-7 minutes after their arrival using their beacons. It took another 7-10 minutes to dig him out. He was buried about 4’ deep, face up, not breathing and CPR was initiated. His machine was buried as well and later located about 60’ downhill.",,,1,Click HERE for photos.,

Slide victim was skilled and careful 
By Jennifer Dobner
Deseret Morning News 
Something in her mother's intuition had told Tami Eastman that a day like Friday might come.

""I always knew I would lose Zachary to these mountains, I just didn't know which one,"" Tami Eastman said, one day after Zachary Eastman died in an avalanche in Big Cottonwood Canyon. ""He had a love of the mountains and a love of the Wasatch.""
Zachary, 23, was skiing with a friend in the Twin Lake Pass area between and above the Brighton and Solitude resorts when an avalanche broke loose above him at about 5 p.m.
He was the first of two people to die in avalanches along the Wasatch Front in the past two days. In addition, two snowshoers were missing late Saturday.
""Zach was in the lead; his friend was in the safe zone,"" the young man's father, Scott Eastman, said, recounting the story Zach's companion told about what happened on the mountain. ""Zach crossed into open space and went to the other side. He said the snow felt sketchy, (so Zach) turned and started to come back . . . and then it just happened.""
Both young men were experienced skiers who had frequented that part of the backcountry, Scott Eastman said. Zachary Eastman had trained in avalanche safety and spent some time working as a volunteer for the National Ski Patrol in the Park City area last year. And as early as last week, both men were honing their skills with avalanche beacons, Scott Eastman said.
""The one thing that's kind of helping me is that they did everything right,"" Scott Eastman said. ""From what I know of the whole scenario, they followed all the protocols and did things right.""
That includes the ""textbook rescue"" attempt Zach Eastman's companion attempted, Scott Eastman said.
Zach's friend, whose name has not been released, located Zach, dug him out of the snow and began CPR, pausing only to call 911 for help. A medical helicopter lifted Zach Eastman out of the canyon and to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
""The poor kid feels really badly, guilty, but he did everything right,"" Scott Eastman said again.
A provisional report of the incident from the Utah Avalanche Center posted Saturday night indicates that the slide in which Eastman died was between 1 and 3 feet deep and about 200 feet wide.
Eastman was traversing a 35-degree, northeast-facing slope, and the snow fractured about 80 feet above him, according to the report written by avalanche forecaster Drew Hardesty.
Zachary Eastman's parents said they can find some comfort in knowing their son died doing the thing he loved in the place he loved. Winter or summer, Zachary, who was studying nursing at Salt Lake Community College, was in the mountains. 
""It was his passion,"" Tami Eastman said. ""He would start (on) Timpanogos and climb all of those mountains. He would take his Ramen noodles and his water purifier and be gone for days.""
Losing Zach to the mountains is somehow easier than losing him to a traffic accident caused by a drunken driver or in another sort of accident, his mother added.
""He was a very sweet boy, and I was privileged to be his mama on this earth,"" she said.
In keeping with his desire to help others and his career aspirations, Zachary Eastman was an organ donor, Tami Eastman added, so his empathy for others will be evidenced, even in his death.

Mountain mayhem 
Slides injure one, claim 2nd victim in 2 days 
By Brady Snyder and Jennifer Dobner
Deseret Morning News 
The lasting image Trace Workman has of his friend Ben Dejong is one of Dejong moving as fast as he could down a mountainside with a massive avalanche barreling down on him.

Brian Gnehn, Via Davis County Sheriff
But 20 tons of snow move much faster than human legs can, and the 27-year-old from Bountiful was overtaken.
""I saw Ben, and he was running as fast as he can,"" Workman said. ""It was like an ocean wave when it comes in, and it just engulfed him. There was this big powder cloud, and as soon as that settled I couldn't see nothing. I couldn't see one sign of him.""
For the next 20 to 25 minutes Saturday morning Workman led a frantic rescue effort that included mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and ended with Dejong's life being saved.
Dejong was lucky, and his rescue served as a joyous highlight in an otherwise dangerous and deadly few days.
Snowslides in Utah's backcountry engulfed at least four people and killed two in the past two days in Salt Lake, Wasatch and Davis counties. Two snowshoers are missing. 

Dejong was caught while snowmobiling with Workman high in Farmington Canyon above Davis County. 
The victim of an avalanche Friday above Brighton and Solitude in Big Cottonwood Canyon was identified Saturday as Zachary Eastman, 23, Salt Lake City. A friend escaped. 
A snowmobiler was killed by an avalanche Saturday near Strawberry Reservoir. His identity has not yet been released. 
And two snowshoers were missing late Saturday in the Mineral Fork area of Big Cottonwood Canyon, where a Salt Lake County search and rescue effort there may have been hampered by slides.

State helicopter pilots assisting with the Mineral Fork search from the air reported ""one major and one minor avalanche in the area,"" Salt Lake County Lt. Mike Wardle said.
The men, one aged 60 and one 32, were reported missing about 5:45 p.m. when they failed to return at the expected time, he said.
Because Mineral Fork is a high-risk area for avalanches — and because the avalanche danger has been so high in recent days — the search for the men was expected to be halted around midnight and resumed at first light, Wardle said.

Keith Johnson, Deseret Morning News
Extreme danger
""All of these slides that have been breaking out have been 3 to 8 feet deep and very difficult to survive,"" said Bruce Tremper, director of the Utah Avalanche Center.
Avalanche forecasts over the past few days warned would-be backcountry recreationalists of the extreme danger and high potential for slides, especially on or below steep slopes.
""We've had all the important ingredients for an avalanche. We've had a quadruple whammy,"" Tremper said. ""A weak layer of snow is one; a whole bunch of new snow, number two; wind, number three; and rapid temperature rises.""
The avalanche-risk assessment, however, was dropped from ""high"" to ""considerable"" as snow conditions began to stabilize Saturday, Tremper said.
Strawberry tragedy
Despite those improving conditions, a 42-year-old man was killed near Trout Creek in Wasatch County's Strawberry Valley Saturday. The man, whose name was not released, was snowmobiling with a friend when his vehicle became stuck on a steep slope, Wasatch County Sheriff's deputy Corey Davis said.
The avalanche was reported about 11:30 a.m., Davis said, and measured about 500 feet long and 300 feet wide. It broke above the man and buried him in roughly 4 feet of snow. His companion was not caught in the slide, and with the help of another recreationalist, who was carrying an avalanche beacon, the pair was able to locate the man — who was wearing a beacon — and dig him out, Davis said.
The two called 911 from a cell phone. Investigators were still trying to determine how long the man was buried. A medical helicopter transported the man to a Utah County hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Davis said.
Twin Lakes Pass
Friday afternoon, Eastman was killed near Twin Lakes Pass near the Brighton and Solitude ski areas in Big Cottonwood Canyon. These are the second and third avalanche deaths in Utah in 2004. A snowshoer died in a Deer Valley slide in February.
""He was a free spirit, and (skiing) is what he lived for, that was his love,"" Eastman's father, Scott Eastman, said Saturday. ""That's the only thing that's giving me a little peace in this.""
Zachary Eastman and a friend had skied the area all day Friday, and both were trained in avalanche safety, his father said. As early as last week, the pair had been to a refresher course on using avalanche beacons, he said.
But sometimes with Mother Nature ""you just don't know which way it's going to go,"" Scott Eastman said.
Farmington Canyon
Dejong might have suffered a similar fate in Davis County.
Workman of Clinton and Dejong regularly frequent the backcountry of Farmington Canyon, snowmobiling below Bountiful Peak. Workman figures they visited the canyon 20 times last year, and with a few feet of fresh snow, Saturday seemed the ideal time to hit the powder again.
""They just love riding up in Farmington Canyon,"" Trace's father, Mark, explained. ""They're these extreme riders.""
It was Trace who apparently triggered the slide, which Davis County Sheriff's Capt. Kenny Payne described as ""very large.""
It was about 9 a.m. when Dejong was using a video camera to film some of his friend's moves in a lofty chute.
Then the mountain caved in.
""I climbed out of the chute and that whole mountainside came down,"" Workman said. ""I looked down, and it was like the whole mountain went out from beneath me.""
Down the hill Dejong desperately tried to start his snowmobile, but the engine wouldn't crank. With a dead motor, the Bountiful man turned and ran, only to be swept up in the powder.
Workman sped down the hill and began desperately searching for his friend. Fortunately, Dejong was wearing an avalanche beacon that allowed Workman to locate the area where his buddy was buried.
Workman dug with his hands for a couple of minutes before being joined by Corey Malan of Ogden.
""We just started digging frantically,"" Malan said.
The rescue
The pair located Dejong's boot about 5 feet below the surface when Malan's two friends caught up with a shovel.
In a painstakingly slow five to eight minutes the foursome uncovered more leg, a knee, a thigh, a torso and finally Dejong's head, which was buried face down.
""At that point it was pretty dark,"" Workman said. ""He was purple and blue and was pretty discolored. At one time I thought he was dead. I thought it was too late.""
The rescuers said there was just a faint hint of breath coming from Dejong's mouth, and Workman offered some mouth to mouth that seemed to help.
The group had already used a cell phone to call for a medical helicopter, and as they waited Dejong lay unconscious for 10 to 12 minutes.
When the helicopter appeared over the mountain, Dejong suddenly sprang to life.
""The first thing out of his mouth was, 'I just can't believe you guys found me,' "" Malan said.
Payne said Dejong was airlifted to University Hospital as a precaution. He had no broken bones or obvious injuries, Payne said.
It was a rescue effort that turned out much better than one Malan participated in back in 1996 when another friend, Rick Adams, was killed by a massive slide in Farmington Canyon. Searchers didn't find Adams' body for over a month.
'A life saver'
The difference was Adams' lack of an avalanche beacon, which issues a transmission that allows rescuers to pinpoint where a person in buried in the powder.
In Dejong's case, his beacon saved his life, police and rescuers said.
""It's a life saver,"" Malan said. ""I won't go up without one.""
Of course, a beacon does not give people a license to cheat death.
Eastman, the Salt Lake man killed Friday, was also wearing a beacon, but rescuers couldn't revive him despite using CPR.
Avalanche forecasters stressed that much of the new snow that blanketed the Wasatch Front mountains last week had not meshed with old snow, creating a great slide danger. Compounding the problem were sunshine and high temperatures, making the snow even less stable.
""That snow had not bonded underneath. Boy, there are avalanches all along those hills,"" Malan said. ""There were at least six or seven in the next four bowls over. It's really bad up there right now. I told everyone I've seen going up there not to go.""
Tremper said avalanche forecasters did allow an avalanche warning to expire Saturday morning, but he said conditions, with high temperatures and new snow, remain perilous.

Twelve young snowboarders rode the Crest lift at Brighton and proceeded past the ski area boundary to Pioneer Peak to build some jumps in the Dog Lake area. As the two victims traversed a very steep, 50-degree slope just below the ridge, they triggered a 300 foot wide, 2-8 feet deep hard slab that took out the entire bowl. Luckily, all of the other snowboarders were off to the side at the time. No one in the party carried any beacons although they did have several shovels with them for building jumps. Ski patrollers from Alta and Brighton responded and located the victims using avalanche rescue dogs. They had both died from asphyxiation.",,50°,2,,Persistent Weak Layer

Finally, on January 31st, the inevitable happened—the first fatality occurred on that fateful layer.
The death of Brian Roust shook the avalanche community to its core because Brian was not only a fellow avalanche worker, but he was very experienced and cagy. Yes, Brian fit the description of the typical avalanche victim as he was male in his late 20’s and was very skilled in his sport. But he did not fit the profile in that he was a very experienced avalanche worker who had patrolled at Park City and was a route leader at the Canyons Resort at the time of the accident. Not many avalanche professionals die in avalanches.
Brian was skiing in one of his favorite backcountry areas on the Thousand Peaks Ranch, which is private land in the western Uinta Mountains in the Weber River drainage east of Oakley. At least three different parties were skiing in the area and one party of four had skied in the area the day before. As the party of four skied one bowl, Brian and his partner skied an adjacent bowl with his two dogs. The party in the other bowl triggered a large avalanche some distance away from their ski track but no one was caught. Brian and his partner saw this avalanche occur and were on their way back up to the top to regroup with others and talk about the situation.
Brian, a notoriously fit backcountry skier, was out ahead of his partner as they climbed. When Brian neared the top of the slope, he triggered the avalanche that killed him. We do not know yet whether he was going up or down when he triggered the avalanche. The avalanche carried Brian and his dog down the slope and buried them.
Brian’s partner and members of the other party searched the debris with avalanche rescue beacons. The first beacon they found was loose in the snow and not attached to anything—which was a beacon that Brian had attached to his dog and the avalanche had apparently stripped off. The searchers found Brian when they located the second beacon, buried 4 feet deep and he was apparently dead from the trauma of hitting trees on the way down.
We do not know whether Brian called the avalanche report before heading out, although the Uinta Mountains are outside our forecast area. On that day, Tom Kimbrough’s forecast prophetically called the conditions “tricky and dangerous” and that the avalanches “break unexpectedly above you and wider than usual.”
On the same day, an experienced ski patroller triggered an avalanche in the backcountry of Cardiff fork, and rode the avalanche about 1000 vertical feet.",,,1,,

Stairs Gulch is a very steep and very large avalanche path (5,000 vertical feet) near the bottom of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Few people venture into Stairs Gulch during the winter but sometimes climbers like to test their snow skills there in spring. As the pair ascended in the early morning darkness a large glide avalanche released high above them and descended into the narrow gully they were ascending. When they failed to show up by their scheduled noon return time, searchers found the boot of one victim sticking out of the snow and a search dog located the second victim about four hundred yards above the first victim and he was buried about 8 feet deep.
This is the first known fatality from a glide avalanche in Utah and perhaps the only one in the U.S. Glide avalanches occur when wet snow slides slowly on the ground, similar to a glacier, often for several days, until they randomly release.",,,1,,Gliding Snow

A small storm had dusted northern Utah, including the Uintas, with 4 to 6 inches of new snow. The Uinta Mountains have a snow climate more like Colorado than the Wasatch Range. Thick layers of faceted snow are quite common and the range is receiving increasing use from snowmobilers. The accident followed a common pattern. A high- marking snowmobiler became stuck and his two friends went up to help him. The weight of the three people and machines released a large hard slab avalanche running on faceted snow near the ground. One of the three was only partly buried and the sleds were on the surface. The search for the missing two men focused on the vicinity of the sleds. Eventually the search widened and both men were found via surface clues but resuscitation efforts proved futile.",,,2,,
